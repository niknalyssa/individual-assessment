<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace; background-color:lightgrey; padding:30px; width: 900px;">The head of the family would be my father, Nik Saladin Nik Mahir. He will be turning 55 years old this year on the 20th of August. He works with an Insurance Company. What I admire most about him is his love towards his children. He would always put his family first before anything else and that makes him the best role model to me. He went to UiTM Shah Alam to pursue his studies, and that is where she met my mother, Norzatul Baizura Mohd Sharin. My mother used to be an accountant but she is now a fully dedicated housewife. She was born on the 17th of July 1968. My mother is a beautiful and smart woman who is really good at cooking and baking. </p>
